* You're only as good as your model, so level up with an <ins>Inpainting model</ins> for killer results.

* Heads up: Setting <ins>Mask Blur</ins> parameter above 0 will give you results that look like they've been hit by the ugly stick.

* Just between us - don't forget to **uncheck** <ins> Apply color correction to img2img results to match original colors</ins> in the Stable Diffusion tab of the WebUI settings. You don't want your results looking like a bad Instagram filter.

## How it works?
<details>
  <summary> Click to expand </summary>
  
To start, let's break down the workflow of the extension into three main steps:

- **Step 1: Choose an image to start with**
The program either generates an initial image using the first prompt you provide or you can upload your own image in the `custom initial image` field. This initial image will be the basis for the outpainting process.

- **Step 2: Generate outpaint steps**
Once you have your initial image, the program will start generating outpaint steps. The number of outpaint steps is determined by the `Total Outpaint Steps` input. In each outpaint step, the program makes the initial image smaller in the center of the canvas and generates a new image in the empty space that is created. This process is repeated for each outpaint step until the desired number is reached.

- **Step 3: Create a gradual zoom effect**
After all outpaint steps have been generated, the program creates an interpolation between each outpaint step to create a gradual zoom effect. The number of frames created between each outpaint step is determined by the `Zoom Speed` parameter and the `Frames per second` parameter.

Number of frames for each outpaint step = `Zoom Speed` $\times$ `Frames per second`

Length of each outpaint step in second = `Number of frames` $\div$ `Frames per second`
